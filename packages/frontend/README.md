This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Environmental Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory. Place the following values into it:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=539193876-qgqjn7o8gkgui54a86c9sdpbmo2o2lnv.apps.googleusercontent.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Running

Run the project by executing

```bash
yarn dev
```

in the root folder.

_Next.JS will start at port 3000 by default._

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

Use this feature sparingly, as we are using the backend server for most API functionality.
